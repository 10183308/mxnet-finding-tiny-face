the code is used to do face detection 
forked by chinakook/hr101_mxnet
and added some Batch processing codes to read images from a folder named"./data/images_stair_enter/"
then save them in the result file "./results/test_stair_enter_results/"

average processing time is 2.6 seconds
total processing time is 164.96s while processing 55 images which is obviously faster than the original code by matlab（https://github.com/peiyunh/tiny）
