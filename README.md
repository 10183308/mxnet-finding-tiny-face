# mxnet-finding-tiny-face

Declaration:
-----
the code is used to do face detection <br>
forked by chinakook/hr101_mxnet<br>
and added some Batch processing codes to read images from a folder named"./data/images_stair_enter/"<br>
then save them in the result file "./results/test_stair_enter_results/"<br>

average processing time is 2.6 seconds<br>
total processing time is 164.96s while processing 55 images which is obviously faster than the original code by matlab（https://github.com/peiyunh/tiny）


Using method:
-----
python mx_tiny.py
