## Getting Started
  * Download the origin author's model [from here.](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~peiyunh/tiny/hr_res101.mat)
  * Transform the origin Matconvnet model to MXNet model using matconvnet_hr101_to_mxnet.py.
  * To run:
    * simply run tiny_detection_mxnet.py

## Differences
  You should install opencv-python 2.4 to get the nearly completely identical result to the origin implemetation.
